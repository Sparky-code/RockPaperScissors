# RockPaperScissors
First Project through TOP (The Odin Project)
- A JS game: Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Updated V2 Javascript & CSS with buttons and styling

# Description:

A rock paper scissors game using HTML, CSS, JS
initial commits focused on a barebones prompt driven gameplay

What I learned: 

- implementing Javascript into a webpage
- building cascading interactions using if/then functions between html/css/javascript
- building adaptive elements using document modifiers
- So many null value and undefined errors...
  - taught me a lot about defining calling elements and functions in proper context and relationship
  
- V2 helped me to refactor and better understand the logic of the relationships between the files and functions
